# Homework 05 Report

1. What does the `in` operator do? Provide examples of the `in` using strings and lists (or tuples). 
   
2. Taking a moment to research, why would one want to use .casefold() instead of .lower() in python when comparing strings? Please include the reference on where you find the information.
   

3. For each of the three sequential types you have learned (list, string, tuple) - label as mutable or immutable (refer to the team activity).
   * string - 
   * list - 
   * tuple -

4. Explain mutability and immutability in your own words.

5. Given the following code:

    ```python
    def mystery_function(x):
        x = 100

    x = 1
    print(x)
    mystery_function(x)
    print(x)
    ```

* What is the output of the code above?
  
* Explain why the output is what it is.


6. Given the following code:

    ```python
    def mystery_function(x):
        x[0] = 100

    x = [1, 2, 3]
    print(x)
    mystery_function(x)
    print(x)
    ```
* What is the output of the code above? 

* Explain why the output is what it is.

7. Would happen if `x` was a tuple? What is generated when you try to run the code above with a tuple?

    ```
    # put the error message here


    ```


8. Given the following code:

    ```python
    def mystery_function(x):
        x[1][0] = 100

    x = (3, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
    print(x)
    mystery_function(x)
    print(x)
    ```

* What is the output of the code above?


## Deeper Thinking

We talked a lot about immutable and mutable. Why would this matter? Take a moment to describe in your own words why computers would care. Pay particular attention to how computers store data in memory, and how making something immutable may help with that storage.

### Software Engineering Exploration and Reflection (Deeper Thinking Part 2)

As someone learning about software engineering and application development, you need to understand the real-world complexities and challenges that professional developers face when building large-scale applications. This assignment will help you explore the field and reflect on what it means to work in software development.


Find three different sources that discuss major complications, failures, or challenges in building real-world applications. Look for diverse perspectives - perhaps a case study of a software failure, a technical blog post from an engineering team discussing lessons learned, or an industry report on development challenges. Very are a fair number of blogs on switching from one language to another, and why that was selected. Your sources should come from credible places like engineering blogs, tech publications, academic sources, or documented case studies.

After reading your sources, write a reflective response (3 paragraphs, approximately 150-200 words each) that explores:

- What surprised you most about the challenges these applications faced? What complications did you not expect, and how do these real-world problems differ from what you might encounter in coursework or small personal projects?

- Based on your research, how do you now view the role of a software engineer? What skills beyond coding seem most important, and what aspects of the job appear most challenging or rewarding?

- How does this research influence your understanding of software development as a career field? What areas would you want to learn more about, and what questions do you still have about working in application development?

This is a personal reflection meant to help you think more deeply about the software engineering field. Focus on your genuine reactions and insights rather than trying to provide "correct" answers. Include mentions of your sources, but the emphasis should be on your own thinking and learning process. Make sure to link your sources, and write your reflection below.
